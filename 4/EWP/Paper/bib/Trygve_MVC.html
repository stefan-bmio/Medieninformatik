	 <p>I spent a very happy and inspiring year as a visiting scientist with the
		Learning Research Gorup (LRG) at Xerox P<font size="-1">ARC</font> 
from the summer og 1978 to the summer of 1979. This group was dedicated 
to Alan Kay's vision of the Dynabook; a portable computer that should 
contain all data of interest to its owner/user. Very importantly, these 
data included the programs the owner used to manipulate them. The 
owner/user should be able to understand and write the programs, thus 
gaining ascendancy over the computer.</p>
	 <p>The MVC notes should be read on this background. The user was the 
czar;  everything done at LRG was done to support him. An earlier paper 
adds  some background for MVC:</p>

	 <p> I
	   have sometimes been given more credit than is my due, so I should stress that I
	   am not one of the original inventors of Smalltalk. I am only one of the very
	   early and very enthusiastic users and contributors to this revolutionary
	   innovation. I made the first implementation and wrote the original MVC note at Xerox
		PARC in 1978. The note defines four terms; Model, View, Controller and Editor .
		The Editor is an ephemeral component that the View creates on demand as an
		interface between the View and the input devices such as mouse and
	 keyboard.</p>
  <p>Jim Althoff and others implemented a version of MVC for the Smalltalk-80
		class library after I had left Xerox P<font size="-1">ARC</font>; I was in not
		involved in this work. Jim Althoff uses the term Controller somewhat
		differently from me. An important aspect of the original MVC was that its
		Controller was responsible for creating and coordinating its subordinate views.
		Also, in my later MVC implementations, a view accepts and handles user input
		relevant to itself. The Controller accepts and handles input relevant to the
		Controller/View assembly as a whole, now called the <i>Tool</i>.</p> 
	 <p>The essential purpose of MVC is to bridge the gap between the human
		user's mental model and the digital model that exists in the computer. The
		ideal MVC solution supports the user illusion of seeing and manipulating the
		domain information directly. The structure is useful if the user needs to see
		the same model element simultaneously in different contexts and/or from
		different viewpoints. The figure below illustrates the idea.</p>

	 <p>MVC was conceived as a general solution to the problem of users
		controlling a large and complex data set. The hardest part was to hit upon good
		names for the different architectural components. Model-View-Editor was the
		first set: </p>

	 <p>After long discussions, particularly with Adele Goldberg, we ended with
		the terms Model-View-Controller: </p>

	 <p>The Controller was here what I now call a <i>Tool</i>. The Smalltalk-80
		Controller is here a fourth element called <i>Editor</i>. This was an ephemeral
		component that the View creates on demand as an interface between the View and
		the input devices such as mouse and keyboard. </p> 
	 <p><i>The MVC problem has more facets than I realized in 1979. I started working
		on a pattern language to disentangle the different aspects, that last 
		draft was dated August 20, 2003. The plan was that it should be improved by a group of authors, not just the current single</i><em> one. Unfortunately, the projct died at his point.</em></p>
